At the heart of nanou is a clear mission: to make finding trustworthy childcare easier for families.

> Finding childcare should not require blind trust or relying solely on word of mouth.

As parents, we have experienced firsthand how challenging it can be to find reliable childcare. The awkwardness of asking around, the uncertainty about qualifications, and the lack of clear information made us realize there had to be a better way.

As technologists, we are addressing this challenge by creating a platform that applies verification processes to childcare. Our goal is to use our technical expertise to transform how families find and connect with caregivers they can trust.

What we are building:

- A verification system for more transparency than word-of-mouth recommendations
- A platform that reduces uncertainty in childcare decisions
- A way for qualified caregivers to showcase their credentials
- A tool that gives parents confidence without awkward conversations

Many families worldwide struggle with finding childcare they can trust. This is a universal challenge that crosses borders and cultures. We believe technology can help by creating more transparency and better verification processes.

We are at the beginning of this journey and are developing nanou with a focus on solving real problems for parents like ourselves. Join us as we work toward building a solution that makes childcare decisions easier and more reassuring.
