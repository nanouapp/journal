Finding trustworthy childcare is one of the biggest challenges parents face today. As working arrangements become more flexible and family structures more diverse, the need for reliable, verified childcare solutions has never been greater. That's why we are developing **nanou** – a platform connecting parents with thoroughly verified childcare providers.

## The childcare challenge

If you are a parent, you know the feeling: the anxiety of leaving your child with someone new, the hours spent searching for the right caregiver and the endless reference checks. Traditional methods often lack standardized verification, transparency, and flexibility.

Research highlights the widespread nature of these challenges, with both global trends and local realities:

- Finding flexible childcare is a significant challenge worldwide (43% globally[^1]), with regions like Cyprus seeing even higher rates (59%[^2])
  
- Trust concerns are universal, with 71% of families globally[^3] and 73% in Cyprus[^4] worried about the quality and reliability of available childcare options
  
- Affordability remains a barrier across developed nations (over 60% globally[^5]), including in Cyprus where 67% of households find formal childcare services difficult to afford[^6]
  
- Career impact is substantial, with 58% of parents worldwide[^7] and 65% in Cyprus[^4] making significant career adjustments due to childcare challenges

> Behind these statistics are real families struggling to balance work, life, and quality childcare.


## Our solution: RegTech innovation in childcare

At nanou, we are pioneering the application of RegTech to revolutionise the childcare industry. Traditionally, RegTech solutions have transformed compliance in financial services. We are applying these powerful principles to childcare verification! Our platform is being built on the premise that sophisticated regulatory technology can automate and enhance compliance processes, building a stronger foundation of trust for families.

Unlike traditional approaches that rely on basic identity checks or limited references, our system takes a holistic view of provider verification through intelligent, automated processes. We combine multiple verification dimensions with regulatory intelligence to create a dynamic trust environment that continuously evaluates caregivers over time.

What makes our approach distinctive is not just the depth of verification, but its ongoing nature. Rather than a one-time check that becomes obsolete, our system maintains vigilance throughout a caregiver's time on our platform, giving parents continuous peace of mind while ensuring regulatory compliance is automatically maintained.

## Our journey and vision

nanou was born from our personal experience and need. We have experienced firsthand the challenges of finding reliable childcare—the anxiety of entrusting our children to caregivers we barely knew, and the time-consuming process of looking for reliable and verified individuals. We recognised that technology could provide a solution that traditional methods couldn't, particularly through the application of RegTech principles to the childcare industry.

Our vision is to redefine childcare accessibility by creating a secure, user-friendly platform that seamlessly connects parents with trusted caregivers, while pioneering the application of RegTech in the family services sector. This approach positions us at the intersection of childcare, technology, and regulatory innovation.

Our regulatory technology foundation is designed to adapt to different compliance requirements, making our platform uniquely scalable across various regulatory environments as we grow. 

Our mission is consistent: harness advanced technology to make quality childcare more accessible, safer, and easier for families, while setting new standards for regulatory compliance through automation and intelligent verification systems.

This mission is particularly important in today's workforce landscape where childcare challenges remain a significant barrier to workforce participation, especially for women. Better childcare solutions can help address this imbalance and unlock economic potential for families and communities alike.
